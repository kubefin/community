## Introduction

KubeFin is a platform built on Kubernetes that enables you to efficiently gain insights into and reduce costs for your Kubernetes clusters.

With KubeFin, you can effortlessly analyze and minimize your cloud expenses, ensuring optimal utilization of resources.

Visit [website](https://kubefin.dev/)  for information about KubeFin.

## KubeFin authors

KubeFin is an open source project with an active development community. The project was initialized by the open source community with bootstrap contributors from 2+ different organizations.

### Authoring samples

TBD

## Meetings and work groups

Every week we host a community meeting to showcase new features, review upcoming milestones, and engage in a Q&A. All are welcome!

Community members (members of the KubeFin GitHub org) can nominate themselves via an issue on the kubeFin/community repository to be a community call host. Members become approved community call hosts when two or more existing community hosts approve their request.

To accomodate different timezones and languages, we schedule community calls at different times zone and use English and Chinese languages one by one.

## How can I help

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions at community engagements.

If you're looking for something to work on, read the [contribution guidelines](https://kubefin.dev/docs/) and then you start by looking for GitHub issues, marked with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/kubefin/kubefin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/kubefin/kubefin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels.

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered whilst using KubeFin.
